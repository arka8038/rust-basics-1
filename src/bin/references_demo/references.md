# Rust Ownership and Borrowing Examples

This project demonstrates fundamental concepts in Rust such as ownership, borrowing, references, and mutable references.

## Introduction

Rust is designed to ensure memory safety while providing high performance, and one of the key components that make this possible is its ownership model. In this project, we cover the essential features of **ownership**, **borrowing**, and **references**, with practical examples and explanations of how these rules work.

## Concepts Covered

- **Ownership**: Rust ensures memory safety by enforcing that each value has a single owner. Once the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped.
- **Borrowing**: You can pass a reference to a variable without transferring ownership.
- **Immutable References**: Multiple immutable references are allowed, but no mutable references can coexist with an immutable reference.
- **Mutable References**: Only one mutable reference is allowed at a time to ensure there are no data races.
- **Conflicts**: Rust prevents situations where both mutable and immutable references exist simultaneously.

## Examples

### Multiple Immutable References

In Rust, it's possible to have multiple immutable references to a value. This example shows how you can safely pass multiple references of the same value without transferring ownership.

```rust
fn demonstrate_multiple_references() {
    let original_string = String::from("hello");

    let reference1 = &original_string;
    let reference2 = &original_string;
    let reference3 = &original_string;

    println!("original_string: {}", original_string);
    println!("reference1: {}", reference1);
    println!("reference2: {}", reference2);
    println!("reference3: {}", reference3);
}
```

In this example:
- Ownership remains with `original_string`.
- Multiple immutable references (`reference1`, `reference2`, `reference3`) can coexist safely.

### Borrowing in Functions

Borrowing allows you to pass a reference of a variable to a function without transferring ownership.

```rust
fn demonstrate_borrowing_function() {
    let my_string = String::from("hello, borrowing example");
    
    print_borrowed_variable(&my_string);
    println!("my_string after borrowing: {}", my_string);
}

fn print_borrowed_variable(borrowed_string: &String) {
    println!("Borrowed string: {}", borrowed_string);
}
```

In this example:
- The function `print_borrowed_variable` borrows `my_string` by reference.
- Ownership remains with `my_string`, allowing it to be used after the function call.

### Single Mutable Reference

Rust enforces that only one mutable reference is allowed at any given time to ensure safe mutation of values.

```rust
fn demonstrate_single_mutable_reference() {
    let mut mutable_string = String::from("hello, mutable example");

    let mutable_reference = &mut mutable_string;

    modify_string(mutable_reference);
    println!("mutable_string after modification: {}", mutable_string);
}

fn modify_string(word: &mut String) {
    word.push_str(", world!");
    println!("Modified string: {}", word);
}
```

In this example:
- `mutable_reference` is a mutable reference to `mutable_string`, allowing the function `modify_string` to change its value.
- Rust prevents the creation of another mutable reference while `mutable_reference` exists.

### Conflict Between Mutable and Immutable References

You cannot have both a mutable and immutable reference to the same value at the same time.

```rust
fn demonstrate_mutable_vs_immutable_reference() {
    let mut conflict_string = String::from("hello, conflict example");

    let mutable_ref = &mut conflict_string;

    // Uncommenting the next line will cause a compiler error:
    // let immutable_ref = &conflict_string;
    // Error: You cannot have an immutable reference while there is an active mutable reference.
    
    modify_string(mutable_ref);
    println!("conflict_string after modification: {}", conflict_string);
}
```

In this example:
- The code shows how Rust prevents mixing mutable and immutable references, which helps avoid potential data races.

## Conclusion

Understanding ownership, borrowing, and references in Rust is essential for writing safe and efficient code. These examples show how to:
- Safely borrow values by reference.
- Work with mutable and immutable references.
- Avoid conflicts between mutable and immutable references.

By adhering to these rules, Rust ensures that your programs are free from common memory-related bugs like null pointers and data races.
