## Introduction

Rust is a systems programming language focused on speed, memory safety, and parallelism. This README explains some core concepts and provides example implementations to demonstrate their usage.

## Variables

In Rust, variables are immutable by default. To create a mutable variable, you must use the `mut` keyword. Here's an example:

```rust
let mut x = 5; // mutable variable
x += 1; // x is now 6
```

## Functions

Functions are fundamental building blocks in Rust. They are defined using the `fn` keyword.

### Function Syntax

```rust
fn function_name(parameter: Type) -> ReturnType {
    // function body
}
```

### Function Parameters and Return Types

Functions can take parameters and return values. Hereâ€™s a simple function example:

```rust
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```

### Built-in Functions

Rust also provides built-in functions. For example, the `println!` macro is used for printing to the console.

## Loops

Rust provides several loop constructs:

### For Loops

For loops allow you to iterate over a range or collection.

```rust
for i in 0..5 {
    println!("{}", i);
}
```

### While Loops

While loops continue until a condition is false.

```rust
let mut n = 5;
while n > 0 {
    println!("{}", n);
    n -= 1;
}
```

### Loop Control

You can control loops with keywords like `break` and `continue`.

```rust
for i in 0..10 {
    if i == 5 {
        break; // exit the loop
    }
    println!("{}", i);
}
```

## Recursion

Recursion is a method of solving a problem where the function calls itself. For example, calculating Fibonacci numbers can be done recursively:

```rust
fn fibonacci_recursive(n: u32) -> u32 {
    match n {
        0 => 0,
        1 => 1,
        _ => fibonacci_recursive(n - 1) + fibonacci_recursive(n - 2),
    }
}
```

## Examples

### Is Even Function

Checks if a number is even.

```rust
fn is_even(num: i32) -> bool {
    num % 2 == 0
}
```

### Fibonacci Functions

Calculates Fibonacci numbers using both recursive and iterative methods.

```rust
fn fibonacci_recursive(num: u32) -> u32 { /* ... */ }
fn fibonacci_iterative(num: u32) -> u32 { /* ... */ }
```

### Get String Length

Returns the length of a given string.

```rust
fn get_string_length(s: String) -> usize {
    s.chars().count()
}
```

### Main Function

The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the above functions.

```rust
fn main() {
    // Example usage
}
```
