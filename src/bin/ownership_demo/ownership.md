# Rust Ownership Examples

This repository contains simple examples demonstrating **ownership** in Rust. Understanding ownership is essential for managing memory safely and efficiently in Rust. This guide covers the basics of ownership, move semantics, cloning, and transferring ownership between functions.

## What is Ownership?

In Rust, each value has a variable that is its "owner." There can only be one owner at a time, and when the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped and memory is freed. Rust's ownership rules enforce memory safety without needing a garbage collector.

**Key Rules:**
1. Each value in Rust has a single owner.
2. When the owner goes out of scope, the value is dropped.
3. Values can be **moved** to another variable, transferring ownership.

---

## Move Semantics

In Rust, assigning a value to another variable moves ownership instead of copying the value. The original variable becomes invalid after the move, and trying to use it will result in a compile-time error.

```rust
fn demonstrate_move_semantics() {
    let original_string = String::from("hello, move semantics");

    // Move ownership to `moved_string`. After this line, `original_string` is no longer valid.
    let moved_string = original_string;

    // Uncommenting the next line will cause a compile-time error because `original_string` is invalid:
    // print!("Original string: {}", original_string);
}
```

---

## Cloning

If you want to make a copy of a value instead of moving ownership, you can use the `clone()` method. This creates a deep copy, so both variables are valid and independent of each other.

```rust
fn demonstrate_clone() {
    let original_string = String::from("hello, cloning");

    // Clone the string. Both `original_string` and `cloned_string` are valid after this.
    let cloned_string = original_string.clone();

    // Both strings can now be used independently.
    print!("Original string: {}\n", original_string);
    print!("Cloned string: {}\n", cloned_string);
}
```

---

## Ownership Transfer to Functions

When a value is passed to a function, ownership of that value is transferred to the function. After the transfer, the original variable becomes invalid.

```rust
fn demonstrate_ownership_transfer() {
    let my_string = String::from("hello, ownership transfer");

    // Ownership is transferred to `consume_string`, and `my_string` is no longer valid after this.
    consume_string(my_string);

    // Uncommenting the next line will cause a compile-time error:
    // println!("my_string after transfer: {}", my_string);
}

fn consume_string(input_string: String) {
    println!("Consumed string: {}", input_string);
}
```

---

## Returning Ownership from Functions

If a function takes ownership of a value, but you still need access to it after the function call, you can return the value and regain ownership.

```rust
fn demonstrate_ownership_return() {
    let mut my_string = String::from("hello, ownership return");

    // Transfer ownership to the function, but the function returns the ownership back.
    my_string = process_and_return_string(my_string);

    // `my_string` is valid again and can be used.
    println!("my_string after regaining ownership: {}", my_string);
}

fn process_and_return_string(input_string: String) -> String {
    println!("Processing string: {}", input_string);
    input_string // Return ownership to the caller
}
```

## Running the Examples

To run the examples, simply clone the repository and execute the code using `cargo`:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust-ownership-examples.git
   cd rust-ownership-examples
   ```

2. Run the examples:

   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

## Summary

These examples provide an introduction to Rust's ownership system. By mastering ownership, you can write safe and efficient code without needing a garbage collector. Rust enforces ownership at compile time, preventing common memory errors like dangling pointers, double frees, and memory leaks.
